# Day-Calculator
This calculator can give out the sum of the intervals between multiple dates. It considered the changes brought by the leap years, so the calculation can be applied to any time period in the past or future. The codes here are only a part of the whole program. The core algorithm is in the day_calculator.py. The views.py is used to interact with the webpage. Since it is a Django web application, I only choose to present the core algorithm here for you to review.
